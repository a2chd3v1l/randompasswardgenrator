#### THIS  PROJECT WAS MADE USING PYTHON LIBRARY FUNCTIONS LIKE `string` & `random`.

* `string.ascii_letters`
	- The concatenation of the ascii_lowercase and ascii_uppercase constants described below. This value is not locale-dependent.

* `string.digits`
	- The string <kbd>0123456789</kbd>.

* `string.punctuation`
	- String of ASCII characters which are considered punctuation characters in the C locale: `!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~`
